Life is too short to read mediocre books, and many things are mediocre, but I will probably spend a minute or two to read a blog post regardless. In fact, I love reading short bits of text since it's cheap (to load), fast (to consume), and can be quite refreshing/informative.

Using my side-business [newsmail.today](https://newsmail.today), I have subscribed to lots of blogs and news aggregators (e.g. [Reddit](https://reddit.com), and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)) and I read through tons of posts every day:

And so I have decided to share weekly the articles that are worth reading.
