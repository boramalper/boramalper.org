title: '"Programming" By YAML'

I wrote more YAML than code in the past three months (at a temporary summer job) and it is **ex-haust-ing**.

Some reflection reminded me of:

> They [Sussman and Abelson] felt that the SICP curriculum no longer prepared engineers for what engineering is like today. Sussman said that in the 80s and 90s, engineers built complex systems by combining simple and well-understood parts. The goal of SICP was to provide the abstraction language for reasoning about such systems.
>
> Today, this is no longer the case. Sussman pointed out that engineers now routinely write code for complicated hardware that they don't fully understand (and often can’t understand because of trade secrecy.) The same is true at the software level, since programming environments consist of gigantic libraries with enormous functionality. According to Sussman, his students spend most of their time reading manuals for these libraries to figure out how to stitch them together to get a job done. He said that programming today is "More like science. You grab this piece of library and you poke at it. You write programs that poke it and see what it does. And you say, 'Can I tweak it to do the thing I want?'". The "analysis-by-synthesis" view of SICP — where you build a larger system out of smaller, simple parts — became irrelevant. Nowadays, we do programming by poking.

Written after 10 days and 20 commits trying to set up [Knative](https://knative.dev/) for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) in [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) on self-hosted GitHub CI runners.
