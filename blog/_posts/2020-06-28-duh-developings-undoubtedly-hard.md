I have decided to start a series of blog posts to rant about the difficulties of developing for real-life.

I remember reading somewhere (from [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)? [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)? not sure) that while it's easy to replicate 80% of the functionality that an app offers, the value proposition comes from the remaining 20% of the functionality a **different** tiny bit of which each users relies on. It's quite like [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), which states (in natural language processing) that the frequency distribution of words in a corpus is inversely proportional to their rank:

So while it's tempting to think that a system that knows the most common 500 words ("the", "of", "and", "to", ...) in a language shall be quite proficient, in reality it is the remaining words which give sentences their meaning (now you also know why learning a language is quite hard.)

What is so "undoubtedly hard" about developing then? In my opinion, the way programming is taught in the universities and also on the Web (_e.g._ tutorials) is in a vacuum far from the messy reality of its actual practice and many people including me find the real-world work difficult to adjust to.

I do not have any ambitious goals such as offering a better way to teach programming (I don't think there is) or even as little as to help people adjust; rather, it's to provide comic relief to me and to hopefully entertain you with some interesting reading.
