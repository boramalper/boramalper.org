- [Daft Punk Break Up](https://pitchfork.com/news/daft-punk-call-it-quits/)

    They are [human after all](https://pitchfork.com/news/daft-punk-call-it-quits/).

    And here is [their 1997 BBC 1 Essential Mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0SrmA01Qpk)!

- [Abundant Capital](https://blog.aaronkharris.com/abundant-capital)

    > To be sure, there have always been bidding wars in private equity (of which venture is a subset), but these bidding wars are so frequent now as to be approaching the norm. If capital was actually scarce, this wouldn’t happen, there wouldn’t be enough money to create so many bidding wars.

    Thus act smart Aaron says; on another note, inflation is here.

- [Go is not an easy language](https://www.arp242.net/go-easy.html)

    > Ideally a language should reduce the cognitive load required to reason about its behaviour; there are many ways to increase this cognitive load: complex intertwined language features is one of them, and getting “distracted” by implementing fairly basic things from those simple concepts is another: it’s another block of code I need to reason about. While I’m not overly concerned about code formatting or syntax choices, I do think it can matter to reduce this cognitive load when reading code.

- [Age of distractions](https://www.lostbookofsales.com/age-of-distractions/)

    > By now, where I live, it's been many months of nightly curfews and limitations on travel and social life. I consider myself a very fortunate person to have suffered a relatively small impact from the global pandemic. Nonetheless, I can't stop but think about why my mind feels so exhausted while at the same time requiring a constant stream of stimulus that results in overbearing distraction. 

- [Whistleblowers: Software Bug Keeping Hundreds Of Inmates In Arizona Prisons Beyond Release Dates](https://kjzz.org/content/1660988/whistleblowers-software-bug-keeping-hundreds-inmates-arizona-prisons-beyond-release)

    A Boring Dystopia.

    > According to Arizona Department of Corrections whistleblowers, hundreds of incarcerated people who should be eligible for release are being held in prison because the inmate management software cannot interpret current sentencing laws.

- [Playstation 2 Architecture](https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation-2/)

    Just the right amount of detail for a fan like me! Always brings me joy to read about my favourite game console ever.

    On a more remarkable note, it's interesting to read the magic of hardware accelerators; [the old is new again](https://medium.com/swlh/apples-m1-secret-coprocessor-6599492fc1e1).

    Finally, [the whole blog is one of a kind](https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/)!

- [Keeping platforms open](https://seirdy.one/2021/02/23/keeping-platforms-open.html)

    A well-written article which I would not like to butcher for a summary; read it!
    
    > This article is the second entry of series of posts exploring situations in which FOSS alone isn’t enough to secure user freedom.
